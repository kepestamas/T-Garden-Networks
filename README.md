# T-Garden-Networks

This repository contains the networks and plots from the T-Garden project, both individually and collected in zip archives. 

A part are sourced from the Internet Topology Zoo and the SND library of networks, with some adjustments made in order to create a unified network format and resolve eventual problems, such as missing coordinates, duplicate nodes, etc. 
The rest of the networks are generated networks, created in order to simulate possible topology network layouts on a variety of regions. All networks adhere to the same unified format as the sourced datasets. The generation process is described in detail in the T-Garden article.

For more information and individual network visualisations, visit TGarden.net

The plots are only for visualization purposes!
